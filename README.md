# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# UAE DUBAI AI GLOBAL COMPETITION 2025

Welcome to the **Space Travel Booking Platform**, a futuristic web application designed as part of the **UAE Dubai AI Global Competition 2025**. This platform allows users to book and manage space station trips, check schedules, compare prices, and even find accommodation in space. 

The main goal of this project is to envision Dubai as the world’s first hub for commercial space travel, bringing the excitement and wonder of space exploration to everyone.

## Features

- **Trip Scheduling & Booking**: Users can choose departure dates, destinations (space stations, lunar hotels, etc.), and seat classes.
- **Pricing & Packages**: Display various travel options, including luxury cabins, economy shuttles, and VIP zero-gravity experiences.
- **Accommodation Recommendations**: Suggest space hotels or orbital stations based on user preferences.
- **User Dashboard**: Profile page where travelers can manage their bookings, see countdown timers for launches, and receive AI-based travel tips.
- **Gamification Features**: Achievements, progress tracker, and other interactive elements to make the experience more engaging.
- **AI Assistant**: A chatbot that can offer travel advice and answer users' questions.
- **3D Solar System Background**: Animated 3D solar system with orbiting planets to give a space-themed experience.
- **Accessibility Tools**: High contrast mode, text resizing, and other options for enhanced accessibility.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.x or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-travel-platform.git
Step 2: Install dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
cd space-travel-platform
npm install
Step 3: Run the application locally
To start the development server, use the following command:

bash
Copy
npm start
Your application will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
To deploy your project to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the gh-pages branch
In your package.json, add the following lines:

json
Copy
"homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/space-travel-platform",
"devDependencies": {
  "gh-pages": "^6.3.0"
}
Replace <your-github-username> with your GitHub username.

Step 2: Add scripts for deployment
In the scripts section of your package.json, add the following scripts:

json
Copy
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Now, deploy the app to GitHub Pages with the following command:

bash
Copy
npm run deploy
This will push the build folder to a gh-pages branch, and your site will be live at the URL defined in the homepage field.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with pushing your changes to GitHub, such as receiving a rejected push error due to remote changes, follow these steps:

Step 1: Pull the remote changes first
bash
Copy
git pull origin master --rebase  # Replace 'master' with 'main' if you're using the 'main' branch
Step 2: Resolve any conflicts
If there are any conflicts, Git will notify you. Resolve them and then add the changes:

bash
Copy
git add <file-with-conflict>
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
Step 3: Push the changes to GitHub
Finally, push your changes:

bash
Copy
git push origin master  # Or 'main' if using 'main'
